My name is Jitendra Das. I completed my M.Tech in 2017. I am a backend developer with over 8 years of experience in Java, Spring, Spring Boot, and microservices. I have worked across multiple domains including retail, healthcare, and telecommunications, where I focused on building scalable and reliable backend systems.”

“In my projects, I have designed and developed RESTful microservices using Spring Boot, implemented security using Spring Security for authentication and authorization, and worked with databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL. I have also been involved in integrating multiple services and ensuring system reliability.”

“From a DevOps perspective, I have used GitHub for version control, Jenkins for CI/CD automation, and SonarQube for maintaining code quality. Overall, I enjoy building high-performance backend systems and delivering stable, production-ready applications.”
