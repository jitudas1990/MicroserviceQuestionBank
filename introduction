my name is jitendra prasad das. I have completed my M.Tech from utkal University  in the year of 2017,  I have accumulated around 7 years of experience in backend development. Over the years, I have gained expertise in Java and have worked extensively with frameworks like Spring Boot to develop robust and scalable backend systems.

I specialize in building microservices, designing RESTful APIs, and ensuring the performance and scalability of applications. My experience spans across different domains, giving me the flexibility to adapt to varied business requirements and technical challenges.

In addition to my core development skills, I am proficient in working with tools and technologies like Hibernate, Kafka, and various database systems (both SQL and NoSQL). I am also well-versed in implementing CI/CD pipelines, containerization using Docker, and deploying applications to cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.

Throughout my career, I have been part of agile teams, where I’ve not only contributed to backend development but also mentored junior developers, ensuring code quality and maintaining best practices. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and am always eager to learn and explore new technologies to improve my development process.

I’m passionate about backend development and enjoy solving complex problems while building systems that are efficient, scalable, and secure.
