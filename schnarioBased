Q.How would you implement efficient handling of large file uploads in a Spring Boot REST API, ensuring that the system remains responsive and scalable?
Q.How you would use Spring WebFluxto consume data from an external service in a non-blocking manner and process this data reactively within your Spring Boot application.
Q. Imagine you need to develop a REST API in a Spring Boot application that allows clients to manage user data. Explain how you would structure your application.
Q.Imagine you are designing a Spring Boot application that interfaces with multiple external APIs. How would you handle API rate limits and failures?
Q.You need to deploy a Spring Boot application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure). What steps would you take, and how would you configure the application properties for different environments.
Q.Explain how you would use application events in Spring Boot to notify different parts of your application about significant activities.
Q.What happens if we use both the @Autowired annotation and the new operator to create a bean of the same type(same class) in a Spring Boot application?
Ans - If you use both the @Autowired annotation and the new operator to create a bean of the same type, then you will end up with two different instances of the bean.
When you use @Autowired, Spring Boot automatically creates and injects an instance of the specified bean into your class, while when you use the new operator, you are creating a new instance of the bean yourself. If you create a new instance of a bean using the new operator, Spring Boot will not manage the bean, which means that it will not be included in any of the dependency injection or autowiring processes that Spring Boot provides.
Q. What happens if both application.properties and application.yml files exist in the classpath? What about bootstrap.properties and bootstrap.yml files?
Ans - If both application.properties and application.yml files exist in the classpath, then the application.yml file will take precedence over the application.properties file. This is because Spring Boot considers YAML files to be more readable and easier to manage than properties files.
Similarly, if both bootstrap.properties and bootstrap.yml files exist in the classpath, then the bootstrap.yml file will take precedence over the bootstrap.properties file. The bootstrap files are loaded before the application files, and they are used to configure external resources and initialize the application context. This means that if you have configuration settings that need to be loaded before the application context is initialized, then you should use bootstrap files.
microservice
----------------
Scenario: You have to design a new microservice for a large e-commerce website. How would you go about identifying the boundaries of this microservice?
Scenario: Two microservices need to communicate with each other to complete a business transaction. How would you handle this communication in Java?
Scenario: You are building a microservices-based application, and you need to implement service discovery. How would you do this in Java?
Scenario: A microservice fails to complete a task. How would you handle this failure in Java, and how would you ensure that the task is retried?
Scenario: You are developing a microservice that needs to access sensitive data. How would you ensure that the microservice is secure, and what security protocols would you use in Java?
Scenario: You need to make changes to a microservice, but you don't want to break the existing APIs that other microservices are using. How would you handle versioning in Java?
Scenario: You have multiple instances of a microservice running, and you need to distribute the traffic evenly between them. How would you implement load balancing in Java?
Scenario: Two microservices need to access the same data, and you need to ensure that the data remains consistent. How would you handle this in Java?
Scenario: One microservice needs to send a message to another microservice asynchronously. How would you handle this in Java, and what protocols would you use?
Scenario: You have to deploy a new microservice, and you need to ensure that it can scale easily. How would you handle scaling and deployment in Java?
Q You have a Java web server in production that got stuck: stopped writing logs and doesnâ€™t answer to http requests. How would you investigate?
Logs say OutOfMemoryError - how would you investigate?
Customer clicks on a button and gets NullPointerException, but same case works correctly in development environment. There are no log statements in code that help analyse the problem. How would you investigate and what step would you take to ease debugging such problems in future?
You are investigating an issue and written a JUnit test - it fails as expected. So you start debugger and step over several times, but the issue is not reproduced. Why can this happen?
Your production Java web server typically handles http request in <50ms, but now you see times raised to about 1 second. How would you investigate?
You have multithreaded app which looks properly synchronized, but sometimes it seems that when particular field is read it returns old value. You suspect some synchronization issue, how would you investigate?
