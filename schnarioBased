Q.Explain how you would use application events in Spring Boot to notify different parts of your application about significant activities.
Q.What happens if we use both the @Autowired annotation and the new operator to create a bean of the same type(same class) in a Spring Boot application?
Ans - If you use both the @Autowired annotation and the new operator to create a bean of the same type, then you will end up with two different instances of the bean.
When you use @Autowired, Spring Boot automatically creates and injects an instance of the specified bean into your class, while when you use the new operator, you are creating a new instance of the bean yourself. If you create a new instance of a bean using the new operator, Spring Boot will not manage the bean, which means that it will not be included in any of the dependency injection or autowiring processes that Spring Boot provides.
Q. What happens if both application.properties and application.yml files exist in the classpath? What about bootstrap.properties and bootstrap.yml files?
Ans - If both application.properties and application.yml files exist in the classpath, then the application.yml file will take precedence over the application.properties file. This is because Spring Boot considers YAML files to be more readable and easier to manage than properties files.
Similarly, if both bootstrap.properties and bootstrap.yml files exist in the classpath, then the bootstrap.yml file will take precedence over the bootstrap.properties file. The bootstrap files are loaded before the application files, and they are used to configure external resources and initialize the application context. This means that if you have configuration settings that need to be loaded before the application context is initialized, then you should use bootstrap files.

Q.How would you handle inter-service communication in a micro service architecture using spring boot.
Ans - In a Spring Boot microservice architecture, handle real-time inter-service communication using:
1. WebClient: For non-blocking, reactive HTTP requests.
2. Feign Client: For declarative REST clients.
3. Message Brokers: Such as RabbitMQ or Kafka for asynchronous communication.
4. Service Discovery: Using Eureka or Consul to dynamically find services.
5.Spring Cloud Gateway: For routing and load balancing.
6. Resilience4j: For circuit breaking and resilience patterns.
Q.If your spring boot application is experiencing performance issues at high load. What are the steps you would take to identify and address the issue?
Ans - To identify and address performance issues in a Spring Boot application under high load in real time:
1. Monitor Metrics:
   - Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana with Spring Boot Actuator to monitor CPU, memory, and response times.
2. Analyze Logs:
   - Use ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to identify error patterns and bottlenecks.
3.Profile the Application:
   - Use VisualVM or JProfiler to detect performance bottlenecks.
4.Optimize Database:
   - Review and optimize slow queries, add indexing, and use caching with Redis or Ehcache.
5. Adjust Thread Pools:
   - Increase thread pool sizes for web server (Tomcat) and async executors.
6. Scale Horizontally:
   - Add more instances of the service to handle increased load.
7. Load Balancing:
   - Implement load balancing to distribute traffic across instances.
By quickly implementing these steps, you can identify and mitigate performance issues in real time.
Q.How would you handle multiple beans of same type?
Ans - To handle multiple beans of the same type in Spring Boot in real time:
1. Use @Qualifier Annotation:
   - Specify which bean to inject.
     ```java
     @Service
     public class MyService {
         private final MyBean myBean;
         @Autowired
         public MyService(@Qualifier("beanName") MyBean myBean) {
             this.myBean = myBean;
         }
     }
     ```
2.Use @Primary Annotation:
   - Mark one bean as the primary bean to be injected by default.
     ```java
     @Bean
     @Primary
     public MyBean primaryBean() {
         return new MyBean();
     }
     ```
3. Inject by Name:
   - Use bean names in the `@Autowired` annotation.
     ```java
     @Autowired
     private MyBean beanName;
These methods ensure the correct bean is injected when multiple beans of the same type exist.
Q.How spring profiles work in spring boot application ? How many profiles you have in your project?**Spring Profiles** in a Spring Boot application allow for environment-specific configurations. Profiles are defined in `application-{profile}.properties` or `application-{profile}.yml` files and activated using the `spring.profiles.active` property.
How They Work:
1. Define profile-specific properties.
2. Activate profiles via properties file, environment variable, or command-line argument.
3. Use the `@Profile` annotation to conditionally load beans.
Number of Profiles:
Typically, a project might have profiles like `dev`, `test`, `prod`, and optionally `staging`, but the exact number depends on project requirements.

Q You have a Java web server in production that got stuck: stopped writing logs and doesnâ€™t answer to http requests. How would you investigate?
Logs say OutOfMemoryError - how would you investigate?
Customer clicks on a button and gets NullPointerException, but same case works correctly in development environment. There are no log statements in code that help analyse the problem. How would you investigate and what step would you take to ease debugging such problems in future?
You are investigating an issue and written a JUnit test - it fails as expected. So you start debugger and step over several times, but the issue is not reproduced. Why can this happen?
Your production Java web server typically handles http request in <50ms, but now you see times raised to about 1 second. How would you investigate?
You have multithreaded app which looks properly synchronized, but sometimes it seems that when particular field is read it returns old value. You suspect some synchronization issue, how would you investigate?
