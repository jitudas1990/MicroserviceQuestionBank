In our organization, we use Jenkins as the primary tool to automate the deployment process through a CI/CD pipeline. Here’s how we deploy an application to the server using Jenkins:

Code Commit and Triggering the Pipeline:

The deployment process begins when a developer pushes changes to the source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). This triggers the Jenkins pipeline.
Jenkins is configured to watch for changes in the repository using webhooks. When a commit is made, the webhook sends a notification to Jenkins to start the pipeline.
Jenkins Pipeline Execution (Build Stage):

The Jenkins pipeline is defined in a Jenkinsfile, which contains the stages and steps for the pipeline process. The first stage in the pipeline is to build the application.
The pipeline uses Maven or Gradle to build the application. Jenkins runs the necessary build commands (e.g., mvn clean package or gradle build), creating a deployable artifact (such as a .jar or .war file for a Spring Boot application).
Run Unit Tests (Test Stage):

In the next stage, Jenkins runs the unit tests to validate the new code. We use tools like JUnit and Mockito for testing.
If any tests fail, the pipeline halts, and the developers are notified about the failure. Only when all tests pass, the pipeline proceeds to the next stage.
Artifact Storage (Optional Artifact Repository):

Once the build and tests pass, Jenkins can store the resulting artifact in an artifact repository such as Nexus, Artifactory, or AWS S3. This makes it easy to keep track of versions and roll back to previous builds if needed.
Deployment to Staging Environment (Deploy Stage):

In the deploy stage, Jenkins deploys the built artifact to a staging environment first. This can be done on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS EC2, Google Cloud), or a Kubernetes cluster.
The deployment might use Docker to containerize the application and Kubernetes to manage the deployment in a staging cluster.
We use Jenkins’ Deploy plugin or custom shell scripts to transfer the artifact to the server and run the application. For example, the command might look like java -jar app.jar.
Integration Tests and Validation:

After deploying to staging, Jenkins runs a series of integration tests to ensure that the application behaves as expected in a real-world environment. These tests check interactions between different services and the backend.
If integration tests pass successfully, Jenkins automatically proceeds to the production deployment stage.
Deployment to Production:

If staging tests pass, Jenkins triggers the production deployment. This could involve deploying the application to the production server or cloud environment, typically using Docker or Kubernetes.
The process is the same as the staging deployment, but Jenkins deploys to production instances. The deployment may involve spinning up multiple instances of the application for high availability using load balancers (e.g., AWS ELB or NGINX).
Post-Deployment Tasks (Monitoring and Alerts):

After deploying to production, Jenkins can trigger post-deployment tasks like sending notifications to the team (via Slack, email, etc.) and updating deployment logs.
Monitoring is set up using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog to monitor the application’s health and performance in production.
Rollback (If Necessary):

If any issues arise in production, Jenkins allows us to quickly roll back to the previous stable version of the application. We keep track of build versions in the artifact repository, so it’s easy to revert to an earlier artifact.
Jenkins provides a way to trigger previous deployment versions through the pipeline, either manually or automatically.

Summary: Through Jenkins, our CI/CD pipeline automates the entire process from code commit to deployment. It builds the application, runs tests, deploys it to staging, runs integration tests, and then deploys to production, ensuring consistent and reliable deployments 
  with minimal manual intervention. Additionally, the ability to roll back versions quickly, monitor the application, and send notifications ensures that we maintain the health and reliability of the system post-deployment
